                Very important news

            <p>I was recently on a tour of Latin America, and the only regret I have was that I didn't study Latin harder in school so I could converse with those people.</p>
            <p>If we don't succeed, we run the risk of failure.</p>
            <p>When I have been asked during these last weeks who caused the riots and the killing in L.A., my answer has been direct and simple: Who is to blame for the riots? The rioters are to blame. Who is to blame for the killings? The killers are to blame.</p>
            <p>For NASA, space is still a high priority.</p>
            <p>It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it.</p>
